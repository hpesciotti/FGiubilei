## **1.Introduction**

Welcome to Felipe Giubilei Photography, the website of a Brazilian audiovisual professional with a diverse portfolio comprising a plethora of photoshoots, from family pictures and renowned rock bands to journalistic images of demonstrations and independent short films. The website is designed as an online portfolio showcasing Felipe's artistic creations and aims to attract potential clients who value a skilled and versatile photographer by displaying his work.  

On a personal note, in the search for the ideal theme to build my first website, part of PP1, I was still deciding the object of this task. Starting from an actual premise for my first project is more manageable than creating a fictional business. 

Therefore, I thought about the work of my dear cousin Felipe Giubilei, an accomplished photographer. To my surprise, his work needs a landing page. Thus, besides having a solid theme for my PP1 with excellent visual appeal given by his photos, I can soon grace him with a fully functional website.

## **2.UX Design**

### **i.Strategy**

While researching other photographers' websites, I noticed they were very minimalistic in design, with few text sections and mainly focusing on the photos. The artistic appeal was high, but the page layout structure was sometimes unorthodox. Another thing I noticed is that, in general, there are two types of photographer websites: some more artistic, which belong to award-winning professionals, and the more user friendly ones, with more recognizable sections, sucha as contact details, which belong to freelance professionals specialized in wedding photoshoots. 

I intended to blend those styles, striking a balance between something artistic but also accessible and luring possible clients. I am also looking for a familiar design for the website, and I concluded that we usually connect with photography through Instagram or Flickr. Considering my coding limitations, I looked for design and layout trademarks from those companies to implement on my website.

Some of the photographer's pages I researched were selected by [Webcitz](https://www.webcitz.com/blog/50-best-photographer-websites/) as the best 50 photographers websites.

### **iv.Design**

#### **Imagery**

I used authorial photos, so I had to select images from the photographer's portfolio. As selecting criteria, I wanted images to elucidate his capabilities and versatility. I ended up grouping the pictures into six types, which subsequently became the sections inside the gallery page, those are: 
Concerts,
-   Family Moments,
-   Solo Photoshoots,
-   Institutional Events,
-   Urban Photography, and,
-   Weddings.

#### **Colour Scheme**

The colour scheme is inspired by tones of violet, indigo, and spotlights, as seen in the selected pictures. This theme is currently popular in software development, and it can be seen in the Microsoft 365 icon, Microsoft Clipchamp and [ESRI Ireland's website](https://www.esri-ireland.ie/en-ie/homehttps://www.esri-ireland.ie/en-ie/home), which heavily weighted on the chosen appearance of my website's nav bar. The colour scheme also matches the background hues of the hero-image.

#### **Typography**

I employed three different fonts for the website design. The logo features the Bauhaus 93 font, which is not included in the style.css file as it was utilized in another software to create the logo image. The other two fonts, Inter and Rubik, are sourced from Google Fonts. Rubik font is applied to the navigation bar, while Inter is used in the rest of the website's sections, such as textual elements.
