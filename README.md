## **1.Introduction**

Welcome to Rainforest Cafe’s website! Located in the heart of London’s Soho district, we’ve brought a little piece of the rainforest to one of the world’s busiest cities. Escape the skyscrapers and relax in our plant-filled cafe, or soak up the sun in our tropical garden. Feast on our naturally delicious treats and feel good for doing good, by dining with a sustainable and fairtrade business.

Rainforest Cafe is a restaurant for diners looking for fresh, healthy and natural food. With plenty of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options, finding a place that caters to everyone just got easier!

Rainforest Cafe's website has been created to serve London's locals and visitors who are looking for fresh, healthy and natural food. It gives diners an idea of what the restaurant is about, including its nature theme, its values and an understanding of where its food comes from. The website also offers full access to its menu, complete with icons for those with strict dietary requirements, a description of the menu item and its price. This helps diners to make an informed choice before visiting Rainforest Cafe. Diners are also able to find contact details and opening hours for the restaurant, and can interact with a map showing the precise location of the restaurant. This leaves little room for error when diners want to get directions to the restaurant, no matter where they are. Finally, a booking option is available, giving diners the opportunity to eliminate the chance of having to wait for a table.

Rainforest Cafe is a fictional business, created by Alice Hillier for the first project in Code Institute’s Diploma in Software Development programme.

## **2.UX Design**

### **i.Strategy Plane**

In order to gauge what makes a successful restaurant website, I undertook online research to find common themes, features and layouts. 
Some of the restaurant websites I researched were:

#### **[Las Iguanas](https://www.iguanas.co.uk/)** 

-	Offers Latin American cuisine
-	Horizontal navbar, with repeated links throughout the page
-	Vibrant background colours/links
-	Lots of images of colourful food and tropical locations/beaches
-	Large fonts
-	Features include – ‘book now’ button on top right corner, menu, about, find us, deliveries, parties, shop
-	Subscription prompt at the bottom of the page

As part of my research, I also conducted interviews to identify what a user wants or needs from a restaurant website.

### **ii.User Stories**

#### **First-Time Visitor Goal**

-	I want to find out what type of food I can expect from this restaurant
-	I want to find out about the restaurant’s theme and atmosphere
-	I want to know the location and opening times of the restaurant
-	I want to see if I like anything on the menu and if vegetarian options are available
-	I want to find what I’m looking for quickly, without having to read too much or follow too many links

#### **Returning Visitor Goal**

-	I want to see if there are any special offers
-	I want to see if I can book a table at my preferred location

#### **Frequent Visitor Goal**

-	I want to see if there is a loyalty scheme and subscribe to the newsletter for special offers and discounts
-	I want to visit the restaurant’s social media profiles to find new offers
-	I want to know if there are new additions to the menu
-	I want to know if I can buy any of the restaurant’s products to cook at home
