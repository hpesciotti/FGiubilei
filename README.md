## **1.Introduction**

Welcome to Felipe Giubilei Photography, the website of a Brazilian audiovisual professional with a diverse portfolio comprising a plethora of photoshoots, from family pictures and renowned rock bands to journalistic images of demonstrations and independent short films. The website is designed as an online portfolio showcasing Felipe's artistic creations and aims to attract potential clients who value a skilled and versatile photographer by displaying his work.  

On a personal note, in the search for the ideal theme to build my first website, part of PP1, I was still deciding the object of this task. Starting from an actual premise for my first project is more manageable than creating a fictional business. 

Therefore, I thought about the work of my dear cousin Felipe Giubilei, an accomplished photographer. To my surprise, his work needs a landing page. Thus, besides having a solid theme for my PP1 with excellent visual appeal given by his photos, I can soon grace him with a fully functional website.

## **2.UX Design**

### **i.Strategy Plane**

While researching other photographers' websites, I noticed they were very minimalistic in design, with few text sections and mainly focusing on the photos. The artistic appeal was high, but the page layout structure was sometimes unorthodox. Another thing I noticed is that, in general, there are two types of photographer websites: some more artistic, which belong to award-winning professionals, and the more user friendly ones, with more recognizable sections, sucha as contact details, which belong to freelance professionals specialized in wedding photoshoots. 

I intended to blend those styles, striking a balance between something artistic but also accessible and luring possible clients. I am also looking for a familiar design for the website, and I concluded that we usually connect with photography through Instagram or Flickr. Considering my coding limitations, I looked for design and layout trademarks from those companies to implement on my website.

Some of the photographer's pages I researched were selected by [Webcitz](https://www.webcitz.com/blog/50-best-photographer-websites/) as the best 50 photographers websites.
